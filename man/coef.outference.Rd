\title{Extract coefficients from an \code{"outference"} object}
\usage{
coef.outference(object, model = c("removed", "original"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object, }{an object of class \code{"outference"}.}

\item{model, }{if \code{model = "removed"}, then the coefficients are from the fit with outliers removed;
if \code{model = "original"}, then the coefficients are from the fit with all the data.}

\item{..., }{other arguments.}
}
\value{
This function returns the desired vector of regression coefficients.
}
\description{
This function extracts the estimated regression coefficients from an \code{"outference"} object.
}
\examples{
## Brownleeâ€™s Stack Loss Plant Data
data("stackloss")
## fit the model
## detect outlier using Cook's distance with cutoff = 4
fit <- outference(stack.loss ~ ., data = stackloss, method = "cook", cutoff = 4)
coef(fit, model = "original")    # the coefficients from the fit using all the data
coef(fit, model = "removed")     # the coefficients from the fit after outlier removal
